# DJGPP_RPG

Checking in some old DJGPP 32 bit compiler code from the 90'some

It's horrible, it won't compile now days, but hey, I still have it, so here it is!

The following files were not written by me, but where either libraries I downloaded, or they were code from a book I followed along with:
- audio.h - SEAL audio library
- sound.h
- sound.c - Loads many "MOD" audio songs/files like mod, s3m, etc.
- pcx.c - Loads a "PCX" image file 
- pcx.h

I merged all files into this folder that were different "versions" of the tile engine/game.  It is possible that caused it to break.  However, none of the code is compileable as is without DBJPP and Win98.
